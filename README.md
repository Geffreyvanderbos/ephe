An alternative to Slack Direct Message to ourselves. Ephe is based on [CodeMirror v6](https://codemirror.net).

- Traditional to-do apps can be time-consuming and quickly overwhelming.
- A single page is all you need to organize your day.
- Focus on easily capturing your todos, thoughts, and ideas.

- Table of Contents.
- Format on save (using [dprint](https://github.com/dprint/dprint)).
- Record history (tasks and snapshots).
- Command + k menu.
- Customizable Editor Appearance (Paper, Width).

## Feature Requests are welcome

Ephe is focusing on how to control our today in a simple way.
