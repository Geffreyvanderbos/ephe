# Ephe :  An Ephemeral Markdown Paper.

You can write ephemeral notes on this app. Ephe stores your notes in the browser's local storage, no tracking, no ads, no login.

An alternative to Slack Direct Message to ourselves. Ephe is based on [CodeMirror v6](https://codemirror.net).

- Traditional to-do apps can be time-consuming and quickly overwhelming.
- A single page is all you need to organize your day.
- Focus on easily capturing your todos, thoughts, and ideas.

## Fun features

- Dark mode.
- `-[` or `- [` automatically completes to `- [ ] `.
- Table of Contents.
- Format on save (using [dprint](https://github.com/dprint/dprint)).
- Record history (tasks and snapshots).
- Command + k menu.
- Customizable Editor Appearance (Paper, Width).

## Feature Requests are welcome

Ephe is focusing on how to control our today in a simple way.
But it doesn't mean throw yesterday away.
