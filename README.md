# Ephe :  A piece of Ephemeral Markdown Paper.

You can write ephemeral notes on this app. Ephe stores your notes on browser's local storage, nothing is sent to a server. No tracking, no ads, no login.

An alternative to Slack Direct Message to ourself.

## Why Ephe?

- Traditional to-do apps can be time-consuming and quickly overwhelming.
- A single page is all you need to organize your day.
- Focus on easily capturing your todos, thoughts, and ideas.

## Fun fact

- `-[` or `- [` automatically completes to `- [ ] `.

## Feature Requests are welcome

Ephe is focusing on how to control our today in a simple way.
But it doesn't mean throw yesterday away.
