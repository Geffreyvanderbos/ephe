# Ephe :  An Ephemeral Markdown Paper.

You can write ephemeral notes on this app. Ephe stores your notes on browser's local storage, no tracking, no ads, no login.

An alternative to Slack Direct Message to ourself.

## Why Ephe?

- Traditional to-do apps can be time-consuming and quickly overwhelming.
- A single page is all you need to organize your day.
- Focus on easily capturing your todos, thoughts, and ideas.

## Fun fact

- Based on [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)
- `-[` or `- [` automatically completes to `- [ ] `.

## Feature Requests are welcome

Ephe is focusing on how to control our today in a simple way.
But it doesn't mean throw yesterday away.
