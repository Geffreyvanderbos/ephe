# React

## Editor

We build an Markdown Editor based on CodeMirror v6.

We use packages below to handler text:

- CodeMirror v6
- @textlint/ast-node-types
- @textlint/markdown-to-ast

We focus on English and Japanese.
The editor must be performant.

## Components

We use tailwindcss v4. 
This version is actually different from v3. Please take a look at https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4 .
