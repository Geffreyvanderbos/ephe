# React

## Editor

We build an Markdown Editor based on monaco-editor.

We use packages below to handler text:

- monaco-editor
- @monaco-editor/react
- @textlint/ast-node-types
- @textlint/markdown-to-ast

We focus on English and Japanese.
The editor must be performant.

## Components

We use tailwindcss v4. 
This is version is actually different from v3. Please take a look at https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4 .
